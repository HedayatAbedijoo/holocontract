# This is a prototype Subscription Contract
Since Digital-contract is not finished, so the contract in this project is a fake-contract. 
After finishing multi-signature Digital-Contract, the fake-contract should be replaced with a real one.


## how the things are working?
Alice as a provider can create some contents. Then Bob wants to subscribe to Alice's Content. If he wants to ask Alice for the content, he just need to send Contract-Address and his Signature. Then based on the type of contract, Alice send back his private data based on the level of permission of Bob.

Bob: subscribes as "silver-membership"

Tom: subscribes as "gold-membership"
